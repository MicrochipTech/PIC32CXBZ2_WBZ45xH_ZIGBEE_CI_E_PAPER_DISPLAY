## 1. Introduction<a name="step1">

This example application enables us to develop a Zigbee Combined interface application along with E-Paper Bundle 2 Display in the WBZ451HPE Curiosity board. The [Multisensor](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/PIC32CXBZ2_WBZ45x_ZIGBEE_MULTISENSOR_TEMPHUM13_CLICK) device joins the zigbee network and reports the temperature & humidity data to the Combined Interface and CI displays it on the E-PAPER display.

### Getting started with Combined Interface application along with E-Paper Bundle 2 Display using WBZ451HPE Curiosity Development Board.

| Tip | New users of MPLAB Code Configurator are recommended to go through the [overview](https://onlineDocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-1F7007B8-9A46-4D03-AEED-650357BA760D-en-US-6/index.html?GUID-AFAB9227-B10C-4FAE-9785-98474664B50A) |
| :- | :- |

**Step 1** - Connect the WBZ451HPE Curiosity Development Board to the device/system using a micro-USB cable.

**Step 2** - The project graph of the application is shown below.

![](docs/1_project_graph.png)

**Step 3** - From Device resources, go to wireless->drivers->zigbee->Device types and select Combined Interface. Accept Dependencies or satisfiers, select "Yes". Add USART components needed for console logs and commands. Right click on the "⬦" in Zigbee console and add the satisfier and in the same way add SERCOM0 to the USART console as shown below.

![Thermostat](docs/ci.png)

**Step 4** - The SERCOM0 UART configuration is depicted as follows.

![SERCOM0 USART](docs/Sercom0_configuration.png)

**Step 5** - Select Wolfcrypt library and make sure that "Support random number generation" box is unchecked as shown below.

![Wolfcrypt library](docs/Wolfcrypt_library.png)

**Step 6** - From Device resources, go to Harmony->Peripherals->SERCOM and selct SERCOM2. Right click on the "⬦" on SPI and select SPI Driver. Accept Dependencies or satisfiers, select "Yes". The SERCOM2 configuration is depicted as follows.

![SPI DRIVER](docs/SPI_DRIVER.png)

**Step 7** - The SYSTEM configuration is depicted as follows.

![System DEVCFG1](docs/System_configuration.png)

**Step 8** - From project graph, go to Plugins->PIN configuration and configure as follows.

```
CLICK_EINK_BUNDLE_CS
SERCOM2_SPI_SCK
SERCOM2_SPI_MOSI
SERCOM2_SPI_MISO
CLICK_EINK_BUNDLE_DC
CLICK_EINK_BUNDLE_RST
CLICK_EINK_BUNDLE_BSY
```

![PIN Configuration](docs/Pin_config.png)

**Step 9** - [Generate](https://onlineDocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-A5330D3A-9F51-4A26-B71D-8503A493DF9C-en-US-1/index.html?GUID-9C28F407-4879-4174-9963-2CF34161398E) the code.

**Step 10** - From the unzipped folder copy the folder click_routines(which contains the eink_bundle.h, eink_bundle_font.h, eink_bundle_image.h, eink_bundle.c,  eink_bundle_font.c, eink_bundle_image.c) to the folder firmware/src under your MPLAB Harmony v3 application project and add the Header (eink_bundle.h, eink_bundle_font.h, eink_bundle_image.h) and Source file (eink_bundle.c, eink_bundle_font.c, eink_bundle_image.c).

- In the project explorer, Right click on folder Header Files and add a sub folder click_routines by selecting “Add Existing Items from Folders…”

## 6. Board Programming<a name="step6">

## Programming hex file:

### Program the precompiled hex file using MPLAB X IPE

- The Precompiled hex file is given in the hex folder.
Follow the steps provided in the link to [program the precompiled hex file](https://microchipdeveloper.com/ipe:programming-device) using MPLABX IPE to program the pre-compiled hex image.

### Build and program the application using MPLAB X IDE

The application folder can be found by navigating to the following path: 

- "WBZ451_E_PAPER_Zigbee_CI\firmware\WBZ451HPE_ZIGBEE_EPAPER.X"

Follow the steps provided in the link to [Build and program the application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/tree/master/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor#build-and-program-the-application-guid-3d55fb8a-5995-439d-bcd6-deae7e8e78ad-section).

## 7. Run the demo<a name="step7">

- After programming the board, the expected application behavior is shown in the below [video](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/PIC32CXBZ2_WBZ45xH_ZIGBEE_CI_E_PAPER_DISPLAY/blob/main/docs/CI.gif). In this application the [MULTISENSOR](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/PIC32CXBZ2_WBZ45x_ZIGBEE_MULTISENSOR_TEMPHUM13_CLICK) reports the set temperature and humidity values to a [coordinator device](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/PIC32CXBZ2_WBZ45xH_ZIGBEE_CI_E_PAPER_DISPLAY).
